## About

Using published open data from the City of Seattle's survey of unreinforced
masonry buildings (URMs), a small interactive map web application highlighting
locations of buildings and displaying other properties of these buildings such
as occupancy type, any recent retrofits, seismic risk categorization, and etc.
is presented. Unreinforced masonry buildings (built circa 1910s) have
historically posed a higher degree of seismic vulnerability when compared with
buildings constructed with modern building codes in earthquake hazardous
regions.
